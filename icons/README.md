# Extension Icons

Place your extension icon files here:

- `icon16.jpeg` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon32.jpeg` (32x32 pixels) 
- `icon48.jpeg` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.jpeg` (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple colored squares or use any AI-related icon.
For now, the extension will work without these icons, but they're recommended for a polished look.
